### Backend and Database

- Use Supabase for backend services, including authentication and database interactions.
- Follow Supabase guidelines for security and performance.
- Use Zod schemas to validate data exchanged with the backend.
- Use supabe from context.locals in Astro routes instead of importing supabaseClient directly
